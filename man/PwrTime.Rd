\usage{
PwrTime(
  npg = 5,
  time = list(seq(0, 9, 3), seq(0, 21, 3), seq(0, 30, 3)),
  type = "max",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{npg}{Number of mouse per group.}

\item{time}{A list in which each element is a vector with the times at which the tumor volume measurements have been performed.
If \code{type} is set to "max", each vector in the list should represent measurements taken at the same interval and differ in the final
time of follow-up. If \code{type} is set to "freq", each vector in the list should have the same final time of follow-up and
differ in the intervals at which the measurements have been taken.}

\item{type}{String indicating whether to calculate the power depending on the time of follow-up ("max"), or the frequency
of measurements ("freq").}

\item{grwrControl}{Coefficient for Control treatment group tumor growth rate.}

\item{grwrA}{Coefficient for Drug A treatment group tumor growth rate.}

\item{grwrB}{Coefficient for Drug B treatment group tumor growth rate.}

\item{grwrComb}{Coefficient for Combination (Drug A + Drug B) treatment group tumor growth rate.}

\item{sd_ranef}{Random effects standard deviation for the model.}

\item{sgma}{Residuals standard deviation for the model.}

\item{method}{String indicating the method for synergy calculation. Possible methods are "Bliss" and "HSA",
corresponding to Bliss and highest single agent, respectively.}

\item{vF}{An optional \link[nlme:varFunc]{nlme::varFunc} object or one-sided formula describing the within-group heteroscedasticity
structure. If given as a formula, it is used as the argument to \link[nlme:varFixed]{nlme::varFixed}, corresponding to fixed variance weights.
See the documentation on \link[nlme:varClasses]{nlme::varClasses} for a description of the available \link[nlme:varFunc]{nlme::varFunc} classes. Defaults to NULL, corresponding to
homoscedastic within-group errors.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to be passed to \link[nlmeU:Pwr.lme]{nlmeU::Pwr.lme} method.}
}
\value{
The functions returns two plots:
\itemize{
\item A plot representing the hypothetical data, with the regression lines for each
treatment group according to \code{grwrControl}, \code{grwrA}, \code{grwrB} and \code{grwrComb} values. The values
assigned to \code{sd_ranef} and \code{sgma} are also shown.
\item A plot showing the values of the power calculation depending on the values assigned to
\code{Time}. If \code{type} is set to "max", the plot shows how the power varies depending on the maximum time of follow-up.
If \code{type} is set to "freq", the plot shows how the power varies depending on how frequently the measurements have
been performed.
}

The function also returns the data frame with the power for the analysis for each value specified in \code{ Time}.

\description{
\emph{A priori} power calculation for a hypothetical two-drugs combination study of synergy
depending on the time of follow-up or the frequency of measurements.
}
\details{
\code{PwrTime} allows the user to define an hypothetical drug combination study, customizing several
experimental parameters, such as the sample size, time of measurements, or drug effect,
for the power evaluation of synergy for Bliss and HSA reference models. The power calculation is
based on F-tests of the fixed effects of the model as previously described (Helms, R. W. (1992),
Verbeke and Molenberghs (2009), Gałecki and Burzykowski (2013)).

The focus the power analysis with \code{PwrTime} is on the \strong{time} at which the measurements are done. The function allows
for the evaluation of how the statistical power changes when the time of follow-up varies while the frequency
of measurements is keep constant. It also allows to how the statistical power changes when the time of follow-up is
kept constant, but the frequency of measurements varies.

For other \emph{a priori} power analysis see also \code{\link[=APrioriPwr]{APrioriPwr()}} and \code{\link[=PwrSampleSize]{PwrSampleSize()}}.
\itemize{
\item \code{npg}, \code{grwrControl}, \code{grwrA}, \code{grwrB}, \code{grwrComb}, \code{sd_ranef} and \code{sgma} are parameters referring to
the initial exemplary data set and corresponding fitted model. These values can be obtained from a fitted model, using \code{\link[=lmmModel_estimates]{lmmModel_estimates()}},
or be defined by the user.
\item \code{time} is a list in which each element is a vector with the times at which the tumor volume measurements have been performed, and for
which the statistical power is going to be evaluated, keeping the rest of parameters fixed.
